Visual pollution is at the highest level. We see many different images every day. Same as the built environment we live in a world with built imagery.

If you think about it.. the amount of images (illustrations, photographs, videos)  of trees you may see on an average day could exceed the amount of actual trees you see in a day. Advertisements, movies, newspapersâ€¦in all these mediums we see different  visual interpretations and executions of real life objects and situations. When we are  faced with a challenge to create something say an image or an illustration of a tree.. What would stimulate our imagination? where would we look? A real tree? or an image, illustration or edited manipulated image of a tree. Most of the time we are seeing world around us through images that was created based on another image, interpreted by looking at another image.. many levels of interpretations. Good or bad it is there. Maybe thats why it is hard to be original sometimes.
